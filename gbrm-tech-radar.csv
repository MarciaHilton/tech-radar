FastAPI,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,False,<p>Easy to use Python webapp framework built on Pydantic and Starlette. </p>
OAuth2 using JWT,Adopt,technique,False,<p>Method of authentication and authorization that uses Java Web Tokens.  Using short-term tokens limits the exposure if comprmized.</p>
Gitlab-CI,Adopt,platforms,False,<p>Use gitab CI to build and test containers, package helm charts. Used in conjunction with Gitlab container registry, gitlabpackage registry, containeryard, and artifactory allows the team to create and store build artifacts.  Added benefit of high-side mirroring next day(usually) of images in containeryard and charts in artifactory.</p>
ArgoCD,Adopt,tools,False,<p>GitOps tool used to manage deployments across multiple kubernetes clusters.  Connects to git and helm repos for "truth" of what the cluster state should be.</p>
Argo Workflow,Assess,tools,True,<p>Asses whether team can use Argo Workflows to manage creation of a project [ namespace, deployments, git repos, keycloak realms, clients,users,authorization flows].  In addition to being cloud a native alternative to Airflow, Argo Workflows serves as the foundation for Kubeflow and integrates with Volcano (plugin) with Volcano being the means of scheduling Argo Workflow batch jobs. </p>
Keycloak,Adopt,tools,False,<p>Keycloak can be used as a single-signon tool that integrates applications and users using Tokens and identity providers like centrify, ldap, casport.</p>
Encrypted Secrets,Assess,techniques,True,<p>Need to find a way to encrypt secrets in kubernetes.  How is this done and how are the secrets made available to pods.</p>
Hashicorp Vault,Assess,tools,False,<p>Asses if Hashicorp Vault will allow pre-deployment of secrets and possibly configmaps for applications deployed via ArgoCD.</p>
Containerized workflows in Slurm,Assess,techniques,True,<p>There is some interest in using this technique within our organization.</p>
Plasma In-Memory Object Store,Assess,tools,True,<p>Plasma is basically the in-memory variant of Parquet, enabling different apps potentially written in different languages  to share DataFrame and Numby data scructures in a zero-copy fashion.  One potential application of Plasma is sharing down-selected Arkouda arrays with co-located Apache Ray workers.  Also of interest is settng up Plasma Object Store to leverage fabric-attached memory for some of our integration use cases.</p>
